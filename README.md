| RFID-based Attendance         | Simplify attendance recording by letting participants tap their RFID cards‚Äîsay goodbye to tedious manual check-ins! |
| Email and SMS Notifications   | Automatically dispatch messages to participants or club members upon RFID card tap. Keep everyone in the loop about upcoming events, announcements, or anything important. |
| Local and Cloud Storage       | Store attendance records locally and in the cloud, creating a robust safety net for your data. Even in the face of local system hiccups, your records remain safe and sound. |
| Automated Backup              | After each attendance session, a local backup of the attendance records is sent straight to the admin's email. Double data protection, just like that! |

## Getting Started üöÄ

## Requirements
To recreate this project you need the following hardware components:
- RaspberryPi
- RC522 RFID Card Reader Module 13.56MHz
- 0.96 inch display or any I¬≤C display
- Breadboard
- Push button
- Jumper wires

To embark on your RFID-ClubConnect journey, follow these simple steps:

  <summary><strong>Configure Raspberry Pi for RFID</strong></summary>
  
---
    
  **Important:** Check SPI interface:
  
  1. Run `sudo raspi-config`.
  2. Choose `Interfacing Options` > `SPI` (P4).
  3. Confirm enabling SPI.
  4. Wait for enabling.
  5. Restart: `sudo reboot`.
  
  Check SPI: `lsmod | grep spi`.
  - If `spi_bcm2835` is present, move on.
  - If not, follow:
  
  Edit config: `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`.
  - Remove "#" from `dtparam=spi=on` or add it.
  - If absent, add `dtparam=spi=on`.
  
  Save (Ctrl + O), exit (Ctrl + X).
  Reboot: `sudo reboot`.
  
  This ensures the SPI interface is properly enabled on your Raspberry Pi.
